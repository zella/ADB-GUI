## Known Issues

Was developed and tested on MAC, windows and linux support is limited some features may not work (It should but was partialy tested).
Was tested on variety of devices mainly on NEXUS  5x and emulators

1. Unothorized device: some times the adb devices command will retrive one of the devices as unothorized in this case you should:
  * Press "Kill ADB"
  * Open terminal / command line and write "adb devices" (Running this command from the App not working for some reason)
  * Press "Start monitoring" to get the device list back

2. Some of the functions will not work if the app is placed in path with spaces
